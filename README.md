<h1>Full Body Workout Generator: A JavaScript Application for Generating Random Exercises</h1>

<p>This JavaScript program generates a full body workout by randomly selecting one exercise from each of the six major muscle groups: chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, and legs. Each exercise is accompanied by a predetermined range of sets and reps.</p<>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The program generates a workout consisting of 5 exercises, one for each body part. The exercises are chosen randomly from a list of options for each muscle group. The predetermined ranges for each exercise are as follows:</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Chest: 5 sets x 5 reps</li>
    <li>Back: 4 sets x 6-8 reps</li>
    <li>Shoulders: 3 sets x 8-12 reps</li>
    <li>Biceps: 3 sets x 15-20 reps</li>
    <li>Triceps: 3 sets x 15-20 reps</li>
    <li>Legs: 4 sets x 6-8 reps</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use this application, simply download the JavaScript file and run it on your local machine using Node.js or a web browser. You will then receive a randomized full body workout plan that you can use to stay fit and healthy.</p>
