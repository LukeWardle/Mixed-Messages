<h1>Full Body Workout Generator: A JavaScript Application for Generating Random Exercises</h1>

<p>This JavaScript program generates a full body workout by randomly selecting one exercise from each of the six major muscle groups: chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, and legs. Each exercise is accompanied by a predetermined range of sets and reps.</p<>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>The program generates a workout consisting of 6 exercises, one for each body part. The exercises are chosen randomly from a list of options for each muscle group. The predetermined ranges for each exercise are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>5 sets x 5 reps</li>
    <li>4 sets x 6-8 reps</li>
    <li>3 sets x 8-12 reps</li>
    <li>3 sets x 15-20 reps</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Exercise one: dumbell flyes - 3 sets x 15-20 reps</li>
    <li>Exercise two: dumbell rows - 4 sets x 6-8 reps.</li>
    <li>Exercise three: shoulder press - 3 sets x 8-12 reps.</li>
    <li>Exercise four: behind the back cable curls - 5 sets x 5 reps.</li>
    <li>Exercise five: dips - 3 sets x 15-20 reps.</li>
    <li>Exercise six: lunges - 4 sets x 6-8 reps.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use this application, simply download the JavaScript file and run it on your local machine using Node.js or a web browser. You will then receive a randomized full body workout plan that you can use to stay fit and healthy.</p>
